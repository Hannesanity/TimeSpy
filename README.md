Configuration
To enable email sending capabilities, youâ€™ll need to set up the Mailtrap API by providing sender and receiver email addresses and the API key.

Sign up at Mailtrap and create an API key.
Configure config.py:
Create a config.py file in the root directory and add the following details:
Python

# config.py
api = 'your_mailtrap_api_key'
send = 'your_sender_email@example.com'
rec = 'your_receiver_email@example.com'
Replace 'your_mailtrap_api_key', 'your_sender_email@example.com', and 'your_receiver_email@example.com' with your Mailtrap API key and email addresses.
Using the send_email Function
The send_email function in Tracker.py handles email sending. It uses the API key and emails configured in config.py.

If you do not wish to use the email sending feature, you can remove or comment out the send_email function in Tracker.py.

Running the App
Launch the Tracker App with the following command:
